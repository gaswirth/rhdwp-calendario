## Maybes

-   Abbreviate long titles?

## Questions

-   Do we actually want to block dragging/dropping on past dates + future? (currently allowed)
-   "Delete" quicklink? dangerous? useful?

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts
-   Times and timezones, and the not-fucking-up thereof
