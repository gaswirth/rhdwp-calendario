## Fixes

-   Error somewhere causing last day of calendar view to not show posts
-   Invalid Time error when dragging posts sometimes to Unscheduled

## Features

-   When changing a date of a scheduled post in Quick Edit, put a "dummy" post before saving, to show where the post will be on the calendar...then when you Save, remove transparency as it's "locked in" (refetched)

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts
-   Times and timezones, and the not-fucking-up thereof
