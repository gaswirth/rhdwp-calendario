# TODO

## FIX

-   Set posts as eventSource, maybe that'll help

query date (limiting how far in the future we fetch)

-   Loading animations
-   caching API responses? memoize or something?
-   deal with post times when updating/retrieving posts
-   Allow php versions < php 7.4
-   Custom list view for reordering and dropping?
-   createUseStyles()

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts

## Questions

-   Should you be able to change past posts?

## Notes

-   make sure time zones aren't cray cray somehow
