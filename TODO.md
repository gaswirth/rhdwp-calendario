## TODO

-   posts querying:
    -   evaluate need to re-implement end/"before" post query date (limiting how far in the future we fetch)
-   Loading animations
-   caching API responses?
-   deal with post times when updating/retrieving posts
-   Allow php versions < php 7.4
-   Past events uneditable
-   Custom list view for reordering and dropping?

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts
-   Check that view prefs persist per user

## Notes

-   make sure time zones aren't cray cray somehow
