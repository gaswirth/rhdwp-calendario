# TODO

## Dreams

-   Fetch caching
    -   call a date range (already happening), but keep track of what months have been called, so calls from other views can use the same data.
        -   or is this too complicated?

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts
-   Times and timezones, and the not-fucking-up thereof
