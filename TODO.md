## Features

-   When changing a date of a scheduled post in Quick Edit, put a "dummy" post before saving, to show where the post will be on the calendar...then when you Save, remove transparency as it's "locked in" (refetched)

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts
-   Times and timezones, and the not-fucking-up thereof

## Notes + Additions

-   List View
    -   Show all days even w/o posts attached, allow drag-n-drop in all
    -   rather than show all future, use same Calendar range and allow add/subtract months!
        -   Really, this means the Calendar component can have 2 render modes and use the same logic!
