## FIX

-   caching API responses? memoize or something?
-   deal with post times when updating/retrieving posts
-   Allow php versions < php 7.4
-   Custom list view for reordering and dropping?
-   createUseStyles()
-   When post is set to Unscheduled, make it a draft (or pending)
-   Set end range per calendar
-   Modal
    -   Update rendered values on submit (sidebar + mainview), refresh in the background

## Features

-   Manual list view (drag and drop reordering, w/ days)
-   Loading animations
-   Option: show/include Private posts (and make editable)

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts

## Notes

-   make sure time zones aren't cray cray somehow
