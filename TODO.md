## TODO

-   convert to React Hooks?
-   posts querying:
    -   evaluate need to re-implement end/"before" post query date (limiting how far in the future we fetch)
-   Loading animations
-   caching API responses
-   Are events rendering twice?

## Don't Forget

-   Permissions checks: non-admins can only edit/delete their posts

## Notes

-   make sure time zones aren't cray cray somehow
